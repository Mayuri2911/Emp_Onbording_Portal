The Employee Onboarding Portal is a web-based system designed to streamline the employee onboarding process. It allows employees to register their details, receive login credentials via email, and access their profile after logging in.
The system also provides an admin panel for managing employee registrations, sending notifications, and generating reports. Additionally, a viewer role is included to allow users to contact support for queries.
